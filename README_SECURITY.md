# Database Security Setup - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Your database currently has several tables marked as "Unrestricted" in the Supabase dashboard. This means they don't have proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies, which could allow users to access each other's data. This guide will help you secure all your tables.

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Security Files
- `security_setup.sql` - Complete SQL script to enable RLS and create policies
- `runSecuritySetup.js` - Node.js script to run the security setup
- `checkSecurityStatus.js` - Script to verify security status

### Documentation
- `SECURITY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- `SECURITY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference for commands
- `README_SECURITY.md` - This overview document

### Updated Files
- `package.json` - Added security-related npm scripts

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Check Current Status
```bash
cd backend
npm run check-security
```

### Step 2: Set Up Security
Choose one method:

**Method A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire contents of `security_setup.sql`
4. Paste and click "Run"

**Method B: Node.js Script**
```bash
npm run setup-security
```

### Step 3: Verify Security
```bash
npm run check-security
```

## 🔒 What Gets Secured

| Table | Current Status | After Setup |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `clients` | ❌ Unrestricted | ✅ RLS Enabled |
| `users` | ❌ Unrestricted | ✅ RLS Enabled |
| `profiles` | ❌ Unrestricted | ✅ RLS Enabled |
| `file_upload_audit` | ❌ Unrestricted | ✅ RLS Enabled |
| `upload_link_audit` | ❌ Unrestricted | ✅ RLS Enabled |
| `token_validation_log` | ❌ Unrestricted | ✅ RLS Enabled |
| `file_send_clients` | ✅ Already Secured | ✅ RLS Enabled |
| `activity_log` | ✅ Already Secured | ✅ RLS Enabled |

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data
- **Automatic Filtering**: Queries are automatically filtered by user ID
- **No Code Changes**: Works with existing application code

### Security Policies
Each table gets comprehensive policies:
- **SELECT**: Users can only view their own records
- **INSERT**: Users can only insert records with their own user ID
- **UPDATE**: Users can only update their own records
- **DELETE**: Users can only delete their own records (where applicable)

### User Identification
- Uses Clerk authentication: `auth.jwt() ->> 'sub'`
- Works with your existing Clerk setup
- No additional configuration needed

## 🧪 Testing Your Security

### 1. Test Data Isolation
```bash
# Create test data as User A
# Log in as User B
# Verify User B cannot see User A's data
```

### 2. Test in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Table Editor
2. Try to view/edit data
3. Should only see your own data

### 3. Test in Application
1. Log in with different user accounts
2. Verify each user only sees their own data
3. Check that cross-user access is blocked

## 📊 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Checks
```bash
# Check security status monthly
npm run check-security

# Monitor for new tables that need security
# Review access patterns in logs
```

### Adding New Tables
When adding new tables, remember to:
1. Enable RLS: `ALTER TABLE new_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
2. Create policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3. Test with multiple user accounts

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"Policy already exists"** → Normal, script handles this automatically
- **"Table doesn't exist"** → Some tables might not exist yet, script handles this
- **Authentication errors** → Check your Clerk configuration

### Getting Help
1. Check `SECURITY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. Review Supabase logs for error details
3. Test with simple queries first
4. Verify Clerk is properly configured

## 📈 Benefits

### Security
- **Data Protection**: Users can only access their own data
- **Compliance**: Meets data privacy requirements
- **Audit Trail**: All access is logged and trackable

### Performance
- **Automatic Filtering**: No need to add WHERE clauses in code
- **Indexed Queries**: Policies use indexed columns for performance
- **Cached Policies**: RLS policies are cached for efficiency

### Maintenance
- **Centralized Security**: All security rules in one place
- **Easy Updates**: Modify policies without code changes
- **Automatic Enforcement**: Works with all database operations

## 🎉 Next Steps

After setting up security:

1. **Test thoroughly** with multiple user accounts
2. **Monitor logs** for any security-related issues
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Train team** on security best practices
5. **Set up monitoring** for security events
